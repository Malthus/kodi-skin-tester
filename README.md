# Kodi Skin Tester

Kodi Skin Tester (kst.py) is a Python script that checks Kodi-skins for mistakes that are commonly made (by me). 


Requirements

- The Kodi Skin Tester obviously needs a directory with a Kodi skin and unpacked media files (it won't analyze the Textures.xbt file). 
- It can also use the Kodi language file for all the words and phrases that are available inside Kodi. This language file can be acquired from the XBMC repository: https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/tree/Leia/addons/resource.language.en_gb/resources

- Kodi Skin Tester is a Python program, so it needs Python installed on your computer. It might need some additional Python libraries, but I think (hope) these libraries are all default libraries that a part of the Python installation.
- Kodi Skin Tester has a graphical user interface. It uses Tkinter for it's windows, so this script should be useable on any operating system with a GUI.
