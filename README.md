# Kodi Skin Tester

Kodi Skin Tester (kst.py) is a Python script that checks Kodi-skins for mistakes that are commonly made (by me). 

Use this program at your own risk! Use the issues found by this program as suggestions, not facts, and check them before fixing them!


Requirements

- The Kodi Skin Tester obviously needs a directory with a Kodi skin and unpacked media files (it won't analyze the Textures.xbt file). 
- It can also use the Kodi language file for all the words and phrases that are available inside Kodi. This language file can be acquired from the XBMC repository (Leia-branch): https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/tree/Leia/addons/resource.language.en_gb/resources

- Kodi Skin Tester is a Python program, so it needs Python installed on your computer. It might need some additional Python libraries, but I think (hope) these libraries are all default libraries that a part of the Python installation.
- Kodi Skin Tester has a graphical user interface. It uses Tkinter for it's windows, so this script should be usable on any operating system with a GUI.
